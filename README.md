# DRAFT OF STARTUP 4 KIDS SHELL GAME 2019 #

# README #

## Project : ##

This project is an adaptation from the shell game https://github.com/bnoufel/save_ze_world-learn2shell for the event “StartUp for Kids” 2019. In order to appeal to a broader range of kids, this year we are abandoning space and will be putting the player in the skin of a detective looking for a diamond thief and his associates.
